# Abstract
Adolescent mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, pose a growing global public health challenge, with high prevalence rates, limited data in Africa, and significant social, cultural, and economic risk factors in Nigeria, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive, culturally tailored and school-based interventions. Adolescent depression and anxiety are escalating global public health concerns, with particularly alarming prevalence in Nigeria, where poverty, violence and societal stressors exacerbate mental health challenges, underscoring the urgent need for context-specific research and early intervention strategies. This study investigates the prevalence, demographic patterns, support systems and service gaps related to depression and anxiety among adolescents in Edo State to inform culturally appropriate and scalable mental health interventions.

This study integrates Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory and Cognitive Behavioural Theory to examine how interconnected environmental systems and negative thought patterns shape adolescent mental health challenges in Edo State. The study of 400 adolescents in Edo State revealed a majority of early adolescent females, predominantly Christian, with equal educational distribution, who faced widespread depression and anxiety across demographics, criticized weak school-based mental health services, relied heavily on family but lacked strong community support, and struggled with costly, inaccessible professional care, highlighting systemic institutional and access failures distinct from family-driven or relational risks seen in other regions.  The study recommends strengthening school-based counselling, creating accessible community mental health services, enhancing family support, implementing policy reforms, and adopting culturally grounded approaches to effectively address adolescent mental health in Edo State.
